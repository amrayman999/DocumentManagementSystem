## Overview
The **Document Management System** is a project developed for a college course on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It demonstrates the principles of OOP such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism through a system that manages different types of documents like emails and business reports.

- Create, edit, display, and delete **Business Reports**.
- Manage document metadata such as tags, topics, and creation dates.
- Validate constraints like email body length and image format for business reports.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The programming language used to implement the project.
- **OOP Principles**: Core design methodology for the project.
